## Custom Cursor

This custom cursor feature is crafted using HTML for structure, CSS for styling the cursor's appearance, and JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. The cursor design replaces the default browser pointer with a unique, visually appealing element that tracks mouse movements in real-time, enhancing the user experience with a personalized touch.
